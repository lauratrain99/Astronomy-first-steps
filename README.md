# Astronomy-first-steps
This repo contains all the scripts created for Data-Driven Astronomy online course.
Python is the main coding tool. Some modules like NumPy or machine learning related like sklearn are included. A library related to the astronomical field, astropy is also part of this repo.
This is the first time I use SQL so such an opportunity to be involved in the structured data world. Work related to psycopg2 database adapter is also included to make the connection between SQL and Python.
